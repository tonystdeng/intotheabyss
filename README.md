this is a horro game of a story with multiple endings, i'm not gonna spoile you, go play it yourself

how to run:
this is coded in python aka it is interpetated aka it can not be compiled into and exe file, i am sorry to tell you this
but instead, you may install the python programming language and run my script(main.py) with the python interpetator
please install the pygame library for python to support gui with the pip terminal command tool, for example: "pip install pygame" or else the game won't work
please include the asset folder in the same folder as the scritp so all the images can be loaded or else the game won't work

example in vscode
1. open the github desktop app
2. clone this repository
3. open in vscode
4. run (make sure you have python and pygame downloaded)
